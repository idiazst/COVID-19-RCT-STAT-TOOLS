Statistical methods for analyzing data from trials of COVID-19 treatments

We aim to provide statistical methods for analyzing data from COVID-19 randomized clinical trials.

Specifically, when the primary outcome is ordinal (such as score from 0 to 10), we give 
methods for estimating the difference between (weighted) means comparing treatment versus control,
and also methods for estimating an extension of the log odds ratio that remains interpretable
without requiring the proportional odds assumption. When the primary outcome is time-to-event, we provide estimators for the restricted mean survival time, as well as the risk difference for survival probabilities at a given time t.
